A more nimble software development lifecycle results in a competitive advantage for businesses and their customers.\n\nThe DevOps methodology comprises four key principles that guide the effectiveness and efficiency of application development and deployment. These principles, listed below, center on the best aspects of modern software development.\n\n- Automation of the software development lifecycle\n- Collaboration and communication\n- Continuous improvement and minimization of waste\n- Hyperfocus on user needs with short feedback loops\n\nBy adopting these principles, organizations can improve code quality, achieve a faster time to market, and engage in better application planning.\n\nBy empowering all teams – Software, Operations, IT, Security, and Business – to collaboratively plan, build, secure, and deploy software across an end-to-end unified
